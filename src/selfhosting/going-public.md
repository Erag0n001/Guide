# Going Public

Players are able to launch their server into the public when using this mod!

There are 3 main ways of allowing other players to connect into your server.

## LAN (Only applies to users in the same local network. IE: same house)

* First, get the PRIVATE IP of the machine that will be hosting the server, which can be found opening a CMD window and typing `ipconfig` in it. 
* You will get a list of networks after that, find your current one and get the "IPv4 Address", something along the lines of `192.168.x.x`.
* Finally, paste that IP in your server config and boot the server up, if asked by a firewall, allow it through your private network. 
* After doing so, join using your PRIVATE IP.


## Port Forwarding (the confusing way)

* First, get the PRIVATE IP of the machine that will be hosting the server, which can be found opening a CMD window and typing `ipconfig` in it. 
* You will get a list of networks after that, find your current one and get the "IPv4 Address", something along the lines of `192.168.x.x`. 
* Paste that IP in your server config and boot the server up, if asked by a firewall, allow it through your public network. 
* Now, you will need to port forward your server, this process varies depending on your router but a general guide can be found at https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide 
* After doing so, launch the server back up and join using your PUBLIC IP, which can be found by using a webpage like https://whatismyipaddress.com/

## VPN Tunneling (the easy way)

* Download any VPN program that is broadly available (we recommend Radmin as it's the least error prone) and set up a simple network (follow the tutorial given by your chosen program). 
* Have the rest of the players join your VPN network. 
* Copy your VPN IP and paste it in the server config file. 
* After doing so, launch the server back up and join using your VPN IP.
