# Going Public

Players have several options to make their server publicly accessible:

## LAN (Local Area Network)
* **Get Your Private IP**: Open a CMD window and type `ipconfig` to find your current network's IPv4 Address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).
* **Configure the Server**: Paste this private IP into your server config and start the server. Allow it through your private network firewall if prompted.
* **Join the Server**: Use the private IP to connect to your server.

## Port Forwarding (Advanced)
* **Get Your Private IP**: Open a CMD window and type `ipconfig` to find your current network's IPv4 Address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`).
* **Configure the Server**: Paste this private IP into your server config and start the server. Allow it through your public network firewall if prompted.
* **Port Forward**: Follow a port forwarding guide to open the necessary ports on your router. A general guide can be found [here](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide).
* **Join the Server**: Use your public IP, which can be found using a site like [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/), to connect to your server.

## VPN Tunneling (Simple)
* **Set Up a VPN**: Download and install a VPN program (we recommend Radmin). Set up a network following the programâ€™s instructions.
* **Configure the Server**: Have players join your VPN network. Copy your VPN IP and paste it into the server config file.
* **Join the Server**: Use the VPN IP to connect to your server.
