# Mods

Configuring your server starts with setting up your mods. Mods can be categorized as follows:

* **Enforced Mods**: Essential for connection; clients must have these to join the server.
* **Optional Mods**: Not necessary for connection; clients can connect without these mods.
* **Forbidden Mods**: Prohibited; clients with these mods cannot connect. Useful for servers with strict mod policies.

## Mod Paths

Locate your mod files in the workshop folder:

* **Windows**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\294100`
* **Linux**: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/294100`

## Additional Notes

Use [this tool](https://github.com/Byte-Nova/Library/releases/latest) to rename your mods to their in-game names rather than their IDs. **Apply this tool to a copy of your mods, not the actual workshop folder.**

Enforcing mods that significantly impact gameplay is highly recommended to avoid potential issues.

Refer to our [Incompatibility List](https://github.com/RimworldTogether/Rimworld-Together/blob/development/IncompatibilityList.md) for information on problematic mods.
