# Mods

The first thing you probably want to configure are your mods. Currently, you can have enforced, optional or forbidden:
* `Enforced mods` will be required for connection. Otherwise, the client will not be able to connect

* `Optional mods` are not required for connection and the client will be able to connect without them

* `Forbidden mods` are banned, which means the client will not be able to connect with them. Useful for servers without any mods restriction.

## Mod paths
You can find your mod files in your workshop folder, usually located in your steam folders under:
* Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\294100`

* Linux: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/workshop/content/294100`

## To keep in mind
You can use [this](https://github.com/Byte-Nova/Library/releases/latest) tool to rename your mods to their in game name instead of IDs. <u>Make sure to use it on a copy of your mods, not you actual workshop folder.</u>

We heavily recommend to have any mods that greatly affect the gameplay experience **Enforced**, as they can break things otherwise.
