# Mod Support

Players are able to play online with any mod they want when using this mod!

For server owners: Please follow the instructions on how to setup server mods on our github page: https://github.com/Byte-Nova/Rimworld-Together

For server players: You can play with any mod that is allowed by the server you want to play in! Be sure to ask them for the ones you really like!

We have a WIP compatibility list that contains some of the mods that have been found to cause issues with Rimworld Together: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14f4oJIV82SzqNK-Tyewr0OKxVRgge8xFasivACwRlsA/edit#gid=0
