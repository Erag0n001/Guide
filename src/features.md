## Sites

Players are able to create sites when playing with this mod!

Sites are world map structures that aid players during their gameplay in RimWorld.

To create a site, move a caravan towards a free space in the map and use the site button!

There are two ranks of sites to build:

**Personal sites:** Provide goods for the player in exchange of manpower.
**Faction sites:** same as the other, usually much more expensive and doesn't require maintenance.

There are different types of sites to build but all of them have something in common, they all give resources to the player every 30 minutes of gameplay depending on the site built.

Depending on the site type, they will give the following resources:


|Site Type|Resources|
|---|---|
|Farmland|Potatoes|
|Quarry|Steel ![steel](./images/Steel_c.png =20x20)|
|Sawmill|Wood|
|Bank|Silver|
|Laboratory|Components|
|Refinery|Chemfuel|
|Herbal workshop|Herbal medicine|
|Textile factory|Cloth|
|Food processor|Simple meal|

## World Presence

Players can see each other's settlements and sites on the world map.

When on the world map screen on the left of your screen, you can search for other settlements with a menu.

Other players can not occupy the same tiles as your colony or work sites.

### Limitations

Currently, world pollution and non-player settlements do not sync with the server.

Therefore it is not possible to pollute the nearby tiles and affect another player's settlement currently.

Nor, can you kill every non-player settlement for everyone on the server.
