# World Presence

Players can see eachothers settlements and sites on the world map.

When on the world map screen on the left of your screen, you can search for other settlements with a menu.

Other players can not occupy the same tile as you.

# Limitations

Currently, world polution and npc settlements do not sync with the server.

Therefore it is not possible to pollute the nearby tiles and affect another players settlement currently.

Nor, can you kill every non-player settlement for everyone on the server.
