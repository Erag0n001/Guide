# World Presence

Players can see each other's settlements and sites on the world map.

When on the world map screen on the left of your screen, you can search for other settlements with a menu.

Other players can not occupy the same tiles as your colony or work sites.

# Limitations

Currently, world pollution and non-player settlements do not sync with the server.

Therefore it is not possible to pollute the nearby tiles and affect another player's settlement currently.

Nor, can you kill every non-player settlement for everyone on the server.
