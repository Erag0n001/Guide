# Trade & Transfer
There's a multitude of ways that players can use to trade and transfer things between each other.

## Different ways of doing it
Currently, players can use direct trading, gifting, and the global market for trade & transfer.

## Direct trading
To engage in direct trading, follow the next steps:
* Get a caravan into the settlement you want to trade with.
* Press the `transfer` button to open the window to initiate trading.
* Select the items you want to trade with the other player.
* When prompted, select `trade` as the transfer mode.
* Wait for other player's counter offer.

## Gifting
To engage in gifting, follow the next steps:
* Get a caravan into the settlement you want to trade with.
* Press the `transfer` button to open the window to initiate trading.
* Select the items you want to trade with the other player.
* When prompted, select `gift` as the transfer mode.

## Global Market
To engage in the global market, follow the next steps:
* Build a `comms console` inside any of your current settlements.
* Go into the world map and select the settlement that has it installed.
* Press the `Global Market` button.
* From then on, use the menu prompted to either add or remove things from the market.

## Global Market: To keep in mind
* The global market can only be used to trade `items`, not pawns, anything that can be considered alive and sentient usually can't be transfered through here.
* Things bought from the global market will arrive at the selected settlement at the `Transfer spot` location, or the middle of the map if you didn't have any.
* When selling things at the global market, the received silver will arrive at the selected settlement at the `Transfer spot` location, or the middle of the map if you didn't have any.
