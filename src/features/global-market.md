# Global Market
The global market is a feature that allows players to trade with each other using a centralized trading system.

Differently from the other trading methods, this one doesn't require all the involved players to be online.

## How to use
To engage in the global market, follow the next steps:
* Build a `comms console` inside any of your current settlements.

* Go into the world map and select the settlement that has it installed.

* Press the `Global Market` button.

* From then on, use the menu prompted to either add or remove things from the market.

## To keep in mind
* The global market can only be used to trade `items`, not pawns, anything that can be considered alive and sentient usually can't be transfered through here.

* Things bought from the global market will arrive at the selected settlement at the `Transfer spot` location, or the middle of the map if you didn't have any.

* When selling things at the global market, the received silver will arrive at the selected settlement at the `Transfer spot` location, or the middle of the map if you didn't have any.
