# Factions
Players are able to create factions with each other that provide useful features on the long run.

## Creating a faction
To create a faction, please follow these steps:
* Open the world map and select one of your settlements.
* Click on the `Faction Menu` button.
* If you are missing a faction, you will be prompted to create one with a custom name.

## Things to do with a faction
Having a faction allows you to invite others to it, which unlocks the following benefits:
* Faction members settlements and sites will be displayed using a different color than the rest of the players.
* Unlocks the use of `faction sites`, meaning now they will be able to be built instead of normal ones.

## Inviting players to the faction
Other players can be invited to your faction by a very easy step list:
* Open the world map and select a settlement of the player you want to invite to the faction.
* Click on the `Faction Menu` button.
* You will get an option to invite them into your faction.

## Managing faction's players permissions and membership
You can manage your faction members by following these steps:
* Open the world map and select a settlement of the player you want to invite to the faction.
* Click on the `Faction Menu` button.
* Use the menu that just popped on to do the task you wanted to.

## Faction roles
Factions have different roles that get different permissions depending on the rank:
* `Owner:` Max rank of the faction and has all possible permissions.
* `Moderator:` Intermitent member with some permissions, allowing site construction and member kicking.
* `Member:` A barebone faction member with no special privileges.
