# Events
Selecting a settlement from the world map, players can trigger events at each other's colonies for a fee decided by the server owner.

## Fees
The server owner can set silver cost for the event in the `EventValues.json` file in the `Core` folder.
* All events are free to trigger by default.

## How to use
* The player must select the settlement they wish send the event towards from the world view window.

* Once the settlement has been selected, use the `Event` button and select the event you wish to invoke on them.

## To keep in mind
* If the server has the setting enabled, this action has a timer of 1h that players need to wait in order to repeat it with the same player. This setting can be disabled in the `ServerConfig.json` file inside the `Core` folder of the server.

* The invoking player must carry enough silver to pay the event fee.

* The target of the event must be online.
