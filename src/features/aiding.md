# Aiding
Players can help each other directly using the `aid` feature, sending pawns towards a desired settlement.

## How to use
* The player must select the settlement they wish send the aid towards from the world view window.

* Once the settlement has been selected, use the `Aid` button and select the pawn you wish to send to help.

## To keep in mind
* If the server has the setting enabled, this action has a timer of 1h that players need to wait in order to repeat it with the same player. This setting can be disabled in the `ServerConfig.json` file inside the `Core` folder of the server.

* The target of the event must be online.
