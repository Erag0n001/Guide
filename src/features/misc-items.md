# Misc Items
This mod includes some misc items that can be used to carry out simple functions.

## Transfer Spot
The transfer spot acts as an entrypoint for any transfers you might receive from other players.

This means that anything that gets given to you, will try to spawn on top (or as close to) this item.

If you don't have a transfer spot in your map, received things will spawn at the center of the map.

## Chill Spot
The chill spot acts as a place where your pawns will rest whenever another player visits your settlement while you are offline.

## Defense Spot
The defense spot acts as a place where your pawns will hold whenever another player raids your settlement while you are offline.

Pawns will only hold this place while the raid hasn't started, after that, they will default to NPC raid stances.
