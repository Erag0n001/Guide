# Raiding
Traveling towards another player's settlement will allow you to raid it in different ways.

## How to use
* Get a `caravan` to the settlement of the player you want to raid.

* If the player you are trying to raid is online, you are given the option to engage into an `online raid`. If that's not the case, you are able to do an `offline raid`.

## To keep in mind
* `Offline raids` load a copy of the other player's last saved state, meaning that nothing you do while in this mode will have any effect on the rest of them.

* If the server has the `setting` enabled, this action has a timer of 1h that players need to wait in order to repeat it with the same player. This setting can be disabled in the `ServerConfig.json` file inside the `Core` folder of the server.
