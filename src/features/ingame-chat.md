Players can chat with each other while playing by clicking on the `chat button` at the bottom of the navigation bar or pressing the (default) `P` key.

## Features

The in-game chat includes several features:

* **Connected Players Preview**: See a list of currently connected players.

* **Public Chat**: Messages can be seen by everyone currently playing on the server.

* **Command Input**: Use the chat as a console by entering specific commands.

* **Notifications**: Receive noise notifications for new messages (can be disabled in the mod config).

* **Autoscrolling**: Automatically scrolls to show new messages.

* **Color coding**: A neat way to display text with different colors.

* **Whispers**: Send messages privately from one player to another.
