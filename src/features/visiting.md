# Visiting
Traveling towards another player's settlement will allow you to visit it in different ways.

## How to use
* Get a `caravan` to the settlement of the player you want to visit.

* If the player you are trying to visit is online, you are given the option to engage into an `online visit`. If that's not the case, you are able to do an `offline visit`.

## To keep in mind
`Offline visits` load a copy of the other player's last saved state, meaning that nothing you do while in this mode will have any effect on the rest of them.
