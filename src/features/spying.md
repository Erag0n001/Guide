# Spying
Traveling towards another player's settlement will allow you to spy on it.

## How to use
* Get a `caravan` to the settlement of the player you want to spy on.

* If the player you are trying to spy on is online, you are `unable` to engage into spying. If that's not the case, you are able to start the activity.

## To keep in mind
`Spying` loads a copy of the other player's last saved state, meaning that nothing you do while in this mode will have any effect on the rest of them.
