# Custom Difficulty
If you want to customize the server difficulty that every player will use in your server, follow these easy steps!

## Step 1 - Disable custom difficulty
To ensure that custom difficulty settings are disabled, please follow these steps: 

* Run the server application.

* Type in the console window the command: `toggledifficulty`.

* Alternatively, you can locate the `DifficultyValues.json` file in your main server folder within the "Core" subfolder.

* Change the value of `UseCustomDifficulty` to `false`.

By doing this, you'll ensure that custom difficulty settings are turned off and the default settings are in place.

## Step 2 - Give yourself admin permission
* Log into the server and give yourself admin permissions by typing in the server console window:
`op "YourUsername"`.

## Step 3 -  Access the storyteller selection menu
To access the in-game storyteller selection menu, follow these steps:
* Press the ESC key.

* Navigate to `Options`.

* Select `Gameplay`.

* Choose `Storyteller Settings`.

* Click on `Modify`.

## Step 4 - Change the difficulty values.
In the Storyteller selection menu, Click on the "Custom" option, where you then  adjust your values just as you would in a regular game.
* Once you've completed adjusting your settings, click the button located at the bottom right of the same window labeled "Send Difficulty" to transmit the values to the server.

## Step 5 - Enable custom difficulty.
* Once you've confirmed the difficulty values you wish to use, be sure to enable custom difficulty again through the server console by typing: `toggledifficulty`

* Alternatively, you can locate the `DifficultyValues.json` file in your server folder within the "core" subfolder

* Change the value of `UseCustomDifficulty` to `true`
